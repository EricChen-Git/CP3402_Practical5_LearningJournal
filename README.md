Learning Journal Entry - WordPress Child Themes

Learning Activities:
I dedicated approximately 8 hours to learning about WordPress child themes through various online resources, including LinkedIn Learning videos and WordPress documentation. The specific activities included watching videos on building child themes, researching WordPress documentation, and exploring tutorials on YouTube.

Content Insights:
The primary purpose of a child theme is to enable the customization of existing themes without directly modifying the main theme files. This approach ensures that changes can be made to the design without the risk of permanently altering the original theme. Child themes also offer the advantage of preserving edits when theme updates are applied, preventing the loss of customizations. The concept of child themes introduces an efficient way to handle styling and design modifications in WordPress development.

Estimated Hours:
Approximately 8 hours.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Child themes are valuable tools in the arsenal of website designers, providing a means to make edits and customizations without the fear of losing changes during theme updates. As a learner, I understand that using child themes enhances styling efficiency and offers a more organized way to manage changes. While I might not foresee using child themes extensively in my career, it was insightful to learn about the backend processes that developers go through to create and maintain WordPress websites.

Practical Task - WordPress Child Themes:
For the practical task, I plan to create a child theme for either my first WordPress assignment or another WordPress site. The goal is to implement at least six visible customizations. I will follow the recommended naming conventions and file structures as outlined in the WordPress documentation. If using Varying Vagrant Vagrants (VVV), I will leverage the topdown dashboard; otherwise, I will refer to the developer docs for folder creation, style.css, and functions.php setup.

Reflection on Future Use:
While I find the concept of child themes interesting and useful, I acknowledge that their application may be more relevant to those specializing in WordPress development. As of now, my career path might not lead me directly into extensive WordPress customization, but the knowledge gained adds to my understanding of web development processes.
